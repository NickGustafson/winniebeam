<h1>Archive site</h1>

<p>My proposed site would utilize a limited colour palette of mostly yellows and browns, based upon the aged pages of the diary itself, with black for normal text and red for hyperlinks.  To add to the period look, I would employ the Google Web Font called
"Old Standard True Type", which is described as being based upon late 19th/early 20th century typography.</p>

<p>The site would be divided into the following distinct navigable sections:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>About</dt><dd>Introduction and project information</dd>
  <dt>Biography</dt><dd>Background Information about the life of Winnie Beam</dd>
  <dt>Timeline</dt><dd>Chronology of events from the Winnie Beam diary</dd>
  <dt>Map</dt><dd>Interactive map of locations from the Winnie Beam diary</dd>
  <dt>People</dt><dd>Biographical information of persons mentioned in the Winnie Beam diary</dd>
  <dt>Artefacts</dt><dd>Scans of original diary pages, photos and other material</dd>
  <dt>Resources</dt><dd>Additional information and related topics</dd>
  <dt>Credits</dt><dd>Project team and sources</dd>
</dl>

<p>Much like the "Whiskey Rebellion" site I reviewed, primary sources utilized in the Biography, Timeline, Map, and People sections would be organized for direct viewing in the Artefacts sections. Additionally, each page will contain a search form to allow the user to quickly access information to match their requirements.</p>
